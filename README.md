Sure! Hereâ€™s a sample **README.md** file for a GitHub repository for a project called **Pipex**. This template assumes that **Pipex** is a program that implements piping functionality (like Unix pipes) in a C program, commonly used in system programming.

# Pipex

**Pipex** is a C-based program that implements the piping functionality seen in Unix-like systems. It allows users to chain commands together using pipes, similar to how commands are piped in a terminal. The project demonstrates the use of file descriptors, process management, and inter-process communication in C.

---

## Features

- **Simulates Pipe Operations:** Execute a sequence of commands with pipes between them (e.g., `command1 | command2`).
- **File Handling:** Allows for redirecting input and output files.
- **Error Handling:** Ensures robust error checking for invalid inputs or system call failures.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) or any C compiler.
- Basic understanding of C programming, processes, file descriptors, and system calls like `fork()`, `exec()`, and `pipe()`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pipex.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pipex
   ```

3. Compile the project using `make` (ensure you have a Makefile in the repository):
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will create the executable `pipex`.

---

## Usage

To use Pipex, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./pipex infile "command1" "command2" ... "commandN" outfile
```

Where:
- `infile` is the input file to be read.
- `"command1"`, `"command2"`, ..., `"commandN"` are the commands to be executed, linked by pipes.
- `outfile` is the file where the final output is written.

### Example

```bash
./pipex input.txt "grep hello" "sort" "uniq" output.txt
```

This will:
1. Read the contents of `input.txt`.
2. Pipe the content through `grep hello`.
3. Pipe the result to `sort`.
4. Pipe the result to `uniq`.
5. Write the final output to `output.txt`.

---

## How It Works

1. **Forking Processes:** The program creates a new process for each command in the pipeline using `fork()`.
2. **Pipes Between Commands:** The program creates pipes between each command's standard output and the next command's standard input using `pipe()`.
3. **Executing Commands:** Each process executes the appropriate command using `execvp()` to replace the process image with the desired command.
4. **Redirecting Input/Output:** Handles input and output redirection using file descriptors (`open()`).
